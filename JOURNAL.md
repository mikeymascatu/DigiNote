## 10/25/2025 - Finished modeling the main frame!   

Alright! The first major step towards completing this project is to get a solid idea of what the device should look like. Major things worked on were:

- The general shape and feel of DigiNote!
- Cutouts for the E-ink Display and carrier PCB!
- Cutouts for the input PCB!
- Cutouts for mounting hardware!
- Rounded and chamfered the majority of rough edges!

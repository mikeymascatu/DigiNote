## 10/25/2025 - Finished modeling the main frame!   

Alright! The first major step towards completing this project is to get a solid idea of what the device should look like. Major things worked on were:

- The general shape and feel of DigiNote!
- Cutouts for the E-ink Display and carrier PCB!
- Cutouts for the input PCB!
- Cutouts for mounting hardware!
- Rounded and chamfered the majority of rough edges!

## 10/27/2025 5 PM - Finished CAD for all Frame Pieces!  

I worked on getting the rest of the frame designed, here's what got updated:

***Main Frame***

- Mounting for the rest of the frame is done!
- Thicker to allow all components to sit safely and securely
- WIP to add cutout for USB-C

***Sub Frame (NEW!)***
- Mounting for the compute PCB
- Safe, vented mounting for a 2500mAh Li-Po battery
- Cutouts for input PCB and cables
- Mounting for the rest of the frame
- Cutouts for FPC cables from E-Ink carrier board

***Rear Frame (NEW)***
- It's really simple right now, but we're adding magnets soon!
- WIP to hide the screws better

and pictures!!

## 10/27/2025 7 PM - Designed input module PCB!  

Quick update! Used EasyEDA and built a simple button PCB that interfaces with the compute PCB with a JST-SH connector. This module will have to hand-soldered since it's double sided (cries quietly) but it will be worth it!

## 11/2/2025 - Finished Schematics for Compute Board!  

Learned EasyEDA and built the schematic for the compute board for DigiNote! 
The computer board features a TP4056 Battery Charger (+ Protections and Load Sharing), the connections to the Eink carrier board, and the input module!
